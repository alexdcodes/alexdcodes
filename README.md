- :innocent: I love, learning about new technologies, playing with german shepherds, belgium malinos<3, snowboarding during winter, and I guess typing all the time in between, if that counts as a life style ;) inspiring people to use open source software, github, developing things. What's your excuse? :D ? 
- 💞️ I am currently living in the terminal, feel free to pipe me to /usr/bin.
- :iphone: Contact me if you want to work on anything or access to private repos/projects (colab work)
